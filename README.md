## Flight Cancellation Prediction


### Overview

This project aims to predict whether a flight will be canceled or not using deep learning techniques. It utilizes an imbalanced dataset, which has been addressed through the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) for oversampling. The model is deployed as a Docker container and can be deployed to AWS ECR and EC2 for scalable deployment.


### Features

- Predicts flight cancellation.
- Handles imbalanced dataset using SMOTE.
- Deployable as a Docker image.
- Integration with AWS ECR and EC2 for scalable deployment.
